To run the game, run the `main.py` file

If the controls of the game seem obscure, this was intended. In the game my project is based off of, the first time you play it it is supposed to be difficult, it only gets easy once you play it the 4th or 5th time around. Even then, the difficulty quickly increases over the course of the game.
