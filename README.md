## Running the Game

`./main.py`

If the controls of the game seem obscure, this was intended. In the game my project is based off of, the first time you play it it is supposed to be difficult, it only gets easy once you play it the 4th or 5th time around. Even then, the difficulty quickly increases over the course of the game.

## Basic Directions

1. Circle Chaser
    * Click and hold the circle until the time runs out
2. Gravity Game
    * Use the arrow keys to place the player in the goal, avoid the black holes and trying not to stray off path
3. Jumper
    * Just move around around and try not to hit the opponents
4. Place Circle
    * Use the arrows keys to place the circle in the square
5. Press Button
    * Press the button the indicated number of times, but **do not go over the limit**
